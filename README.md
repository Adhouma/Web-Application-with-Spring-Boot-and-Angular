# Web-Application-with-Spring-Boot-and-Angular

Well documented example for learning purpose: Spring Boot for implementing a RESTful backend, and Angular for creating a JavaScript-based frontend

This web application's functionality will be pretty simplistic indeed. It will be just narrowed to fetching and displaying a List of JPA entities from an in-memory H2 database, and persisting new ones through a plain HTML form.

# Test the app
Download or clone the project
Run class JavaSpringBackendApplication.java on your favorite editor example(eclipse) on port 8080
